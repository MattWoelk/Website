<body id="body"> <h1>Hello,</h1> <section class="content">My name is Matthew
    Woelk. I am a Computer Engineering Masters student currently living in
    Winnipeg, Canada, and I am looking for work as an Engineer In Training.

    <p>My <a href="http://www.mattwoelk.ca/thesis">ongoing thesis project</a>
    is related to data visualization using web technologies, and it's being
    used to make Structural Health Monitoring data easy to work with. Here is
    <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/MattWoelk/5196687">a simplified demo</a> [<a
    href="http://mattwoelk.ca/thesis/demo">alternative link</a>].</p> 

    <p>I've also just finished working on a <a
        href="http://bl.ocks.org/MattWoelk/5687467">morphogenesis
        simulation</a> [<a href="http://www.mattwoelk.ca/ABM/morphogenesis.html">alternative link</a>] for a course in Agent Based Modelling. You can read <a
        href="http://mattwoelk.ca/ABM/Morphogenesis_Paper.pdf">a paper</a> about
    it.</p>

    <p>I ran a <a href="http://mattwoelk.ca/git-workshop/">workshop on using
        git</a> which was recorded as a screencast. It includes a helpful
    list of commands for using git, with detailed explanations. This was done as part of my duties as the <a href="http://umsats.ca">UMSATS</a> satellite team's Team Lead Internal

    <p>My final year design project was building an Artificial Intelligence
    strategy for a simulated soccer team. Fell free to read the <a href = "http://www.mattwoelk.ca/school/ThesisMatthewWoelk.pdf">large, detailed report</a>.</p>

    <p>Contact me any time at <a href =
        "mailto:matt@mattwoelk.ca">matt@mattwoelk.ca</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/MattWoelk">on twitter</a> or <a href = "http://www.mattwoelk.ca/school/CVMatthewWoelk.pdf">browse my CV</a>.</p></section>
