//this is an overall bin


The additional cost 
associated with an unequal number of components, is 2 times the difference in the cardinality of 
the respective groups. That is if one group has 5 and the other 3, the difference is 2 and the increase in cost is 4.





pick best two:
pick rnd based on low cost.
