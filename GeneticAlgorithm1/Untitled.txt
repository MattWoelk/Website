1)The object is to allocate components into two racks of equipment, minimizing the degree of interconnect. 

Review the course notes for a detailed example albeit very small. 

In this lab if you choose this problem make sure you use a considerably larger problem.

I have included an adjacency matrix in the appendix that can be used as a benchmark. Complete problem specification can be found in the notes. 



Questions: 
1) Did the algorithm run as expected? How did you encode a solution? 
2)What was your maximum score solution? What was the percent improvement from and original or initial “solution”. 
3)How long did the algorithm take to run?If you doubled the size of your problem did the running time scale linearly, quadratically or by some other means? 
4) Vary the initial population size. How did this affect the running time? 
5) How might your basic algorithm be improved? 
6) What was the mutation operation you used? 
7) What was the performance as a function of problem size? 



Appendix: Adjacency list of component connectivity. cij represents the number of connections between component i and component j.
