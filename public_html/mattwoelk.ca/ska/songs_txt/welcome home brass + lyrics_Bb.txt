Well, It's time like these
And it's days like this that remind me I'm living in the wilderness,
And you dont know when trouble's gonna come you way
Or when God's gonna give or take it away.

This life, 
..........E.
This life is fleeting everything,
.................E..............E
Everything's dyin',
...............E.
But one day I'll awake,
........Ab__Gb_____E_______
  All my problems and my sin,
Db__Ab__Gb
Db___B____B_BDbE
The won't matter to me then,

[chorus]
"Son, welcome home."
......B__Db__E    
B__B__Db__Db__D__D__Db__Db x3
B__B__Db__Db__D__D__Db_BDb  

The day doesn't guarantee to come again,
And life only promises that it will end,
And we all gotta stand before the Lord one day,
And I don't wanna die but I don't wanna stay down here
I feel like a stranger,
I know, I don't belong here,
I wanna run and I'll fall down at Jesus' feet and Lay.
........Ab__Gb_______E__Db__A__Ab          
I can't wait to hear him say,
Gb____E.
"Son, welcome home."
......B..Db..E

But I'm still here,
And I'm tired,
tired of sin and struggling,
tired of almost everything
and sometimes,
small and clear
I could swear that I could hear
angels voices in my ear sayin' welcome home.
(chorus without brass)
