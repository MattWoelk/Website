Will by Justin Koop (GTTM)

What is mine, Lord?
What has been given, that I might praise your name?

Is anything mine?
Or is it all a gift to be thrown back your way?

Chorus:
[If nothing's mine, I’d rip my heart from my chest,
I’ll always try to do my best,
To bring honor and glory to thy name]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[TRIPLETS, AW YEAH (NOT A LYRIC)]
(2x)

[Note: 1 phrase of chorus w/o words after each chorus leading into verse,
except for bridge, which is straight in!]

What is mine, Lord?
Is everything yours that I am blessed with?

What is your will, Lord?
Why is it so hard to just give up my will?
(Build for a bar into bridge)



Bridge: (super intense half time screamo w/ triplet feel but singer sings in straight time w/o triplet feel)
Take it from me
Steal my will
Take it from me
like an unseen thief!!!!!!!!!!! (intense) HAH! HAH! (on off beat of
transition) (ala Ska)






Take it from me,
Steal it like an unseen thief,
In the dark of night,
I will lift it to you,
So destroy my will, (staccato)
Annihilate my fear,
Rip out these years of wasted time,
Fill me with the Will Divine,
