Welcome to the world of happy criesA place where the train runs through the skiesWe have come on down from our astral planeTo make you dance from night ‘til dayC’mon!We are the train that leads to marsTracks that run among the starsRelease your bonds, and earthly tiesC’mon the gravy train and fly up high!Ska!The ride is smooth but the road is longLuckily we brought the gravy band along!They’ll groove and move and sooth your moodTake the gravy express past the moon!The train will take you where you wanna goOn tracks made with funk, brass and flowThere aint no stopping this gravy trainIt’s so fast; Don’t lose your brain!Here we go!(Some sort of crazy stomp session!)We’re almost there, but it’s not too lateHop on board or be IRATE!It’s time to dance, and time to skankAboard the gravy train there is no rank,C’MON!
