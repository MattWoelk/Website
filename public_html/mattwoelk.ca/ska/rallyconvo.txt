Heya Kieran,

So I've read a bunch about this rally that you are helping to organize, and Justin's told me that there is a possibility of my band (Gravy Train To Mars) playing at this rally.

Questions: (questions after question 'a' depend on question 'a's answer being 'yes')
a) is this true?
b) how much would we get to play?
c) how many people will be there?
d) i read it was at the forks. Has it been approved by The Forks?
e) how does this group get 'rescued' ?
f) if everyone is rescued, do we still play music, or just go home?
g) what kind of sound equipment is going to be there?
h) is it on a stage, or just kind of on a lawn somewhere?
i) are the other cities that are doing this having bands too?
j) why isn't Winnipeg on the website's list of cities?
k) how awesome is this going to be?

Sincerely,
Matt

a) yes
b) up to 7, probably 6 tracks
c) already we have 90 people attending, I have been on the radio a couple of times already for this, and we'll have more exposure soon
d) we start at the forks and move to the legislature: these things have been approved
e) the group gets rescued when a mogul (a prominent winnipegger such as sam katz) comes and speaks
f) we don't all leave as soon as the mogul gets there, the concert is a celebration of us achieving our goal...except it may start before they get there :P
g) the equipment is still being worked out. we don't want a huge stadium sound system, but we don't want things to be dinky. it will be semi acoustic (i'm working on these things now :P )
h) i'm going to get us some kind of mini stage
i) i don't think that the other cities doing this are having bands. we are trying to be a little different, and because this city has great music
j) i have talked to the invisible children people, and winnipeg SHOULD show up in the next little while :p
k) SUPER AWESOME UBER FANTASTIC!
