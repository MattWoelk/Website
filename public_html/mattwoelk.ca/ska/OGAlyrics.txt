Here lies the old myth, 
breaking the mold with, 
truth to take away the trickery. 
Twenty centuries of progress, 
suffer slowly as we regress, 
losing headway to ourselves. 
Behold the covers, the sisters, the mothers, 
the daughters, and spouses, on the magazines. 
Truth has been abused. 
How could she fill those shoes? 
Propaganda meant to fuel their schemes. 

She is strong but never silent, 
sure of where her truth/strength comes from., 
one day, one girl army will overcome. 

Treading the current, issues at hand, 
Shifting, we sway, from justice and then back again. 
What we once broke, He has made right, 
lifting her up, giving birth to Jesus Christ.
